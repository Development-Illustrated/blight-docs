Area of influence: 200 metres
Maximum pressure applied by people: -0.05 at 100000 resources
    -0.0000005 pressure applied per resources
Maximum resource count modifier applied to people -0.75
Maximum resource count modifier to enemies by landmark -0.5
Maximum resource count modifier to allies by landmark +0.5

The Maths:
Area of effect = 2 * pi * 100 metres
Player pressure applied =
if resources < 100000
    pressure applied = -0.0000005 * resource count
else
    pressure applied = -0.05

Maximum resource count modifier applied to people =
allies total resources = your resources
opponents total resources = 0
for each (players as player)
    if distance < 2 * pi * 100 metres
        if player team == your team
            allies modifier = allies total resources * (0.0000005 * resource count)
        if player team == other team
            opponents modifier = opponents total resources * (0.0000005 * resource count)

players pressure applied:
effective modifier = 1 + allies modifier - opponents modifier
if effective modifier > -0.75
    return effective modifier
else
    effective modifier = -0.75

if effective modifier < 1.75
    return effective modifier
else
    effective modifier 1.75

Landmark growth
if resources > 10000
    resources growth = -300 resources/s
else if resources < 10000
    resources growth = +300 resources/s
else resources = 10000
    resources growth = 0.

If we want the effect to be more powerful the closer you are to someone:
r = resources, x = distance, r_t = current player resource count
